# Title (It's a bird, It's a plane, It's Regular Expressions!!)

Introductory paragraph 

    (they have been called puzzles, games, digit selectors, and all in all crazy strings, but most shudder at the phrase Regular Expressions.)

    Regular Expression is a sequense of characters that define a search pattern. The jumple of these comes from an origin of mathematical steps in order to find and search for data. as seen below the benifit of a very small and accurate shorthand comes at the cost of confusion and technical know how to code.
